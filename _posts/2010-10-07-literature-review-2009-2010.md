<h4>Diversity and Novelty</h4>
The first set of papers concern diversity and novelty in information retrieval.  Search diversity is a new area of search that focuses on ensuring search results lists cover multiple interpretations of a search query within their highest ranked results.

Carbonell J. and Goldstein J., <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jgc/publication/The_Use_MMR_Diversity_Based_LTMIR_1998.pdf">The use of MMR, diversity-based reranking for reordering documents and producing summaries</a>, SIGIR, 1998
The classic that began (?) diversity research.  Maximal marginal relevance (MMR) reduce query results redundancy and maintaining relevance in re-ranking and passage selection for summarization.

Clarke, C., et al., <a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1390334.1390446">Novelty and Diversity in Information Retrieval Evaluation</a>, ACM IR Conference, 2008,
Framework for evaluation that rewards novelty (need to avoid redundancy) and diversity (need to resolve ambiguity).

Agrawal R., et al., <a href="http://www.sreenivasgollapudi.com/pubs/wsdm2009a.pdf">Diversifying Search Results</a>, WSDM, 2009

Within a specific topic diversity is achieved by retrieving documents that cover different facets of that topic.  Attempt to find a small set of documents that covers all the facets of a topic.

Wang J., Zhu J., <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.156.2242&rep=rep1&type=pdf">Portfolio Theory of Information Retrieval</a>, SIGIR 2009
Select top-n documents as a whole by balancing the overall relevance of the list against its risk (variance).  [Note: is there ( if so, what is) the relation to bias variance decomposition?]

Kohlschutter, C. and Chirita, P. and Nejdl, W., <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.61.5433&rep=rep1&type=pdf">Using Link Analysis to Identify Aspects in Faceted Web Search</a>, SIGIR, 2006
Narrowing query with more keywords leads to a higher probability relevant documents filtered out.  Address with faceted search. which divides results into orthogonal categories, works well w/annotated data.

<h4>Personalized Search</h4>
The following focus on personalized search including personalized clustering systems, personalized versions of PageRank, and various other forms of personalization.  These are generally tangentially related to learning to rank.

Ferragina, P. and Gulli, A., <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.97.9908&rep=rep1&type=pdf">A Personalized Search Engine Based on Web-Snippet Hierarchical Clustering</a>, WWW, 2005

Dou, Z. and Song, R. and Wen, J., <a href="http://www2007.org/papers/paper495.pdf">A Large-scale Evaluation and Analysis of Personalized Search Strategies</a>, WWW 2007
Personalized search has significant improvements on some search queries but little effect on others, it decrease accuracy in some situations.  Click-based personalization consistently performs well, profile-based personalization is unstable, long and short-term contexts important to improving performance.

Previous user actions don't always provide a good indication of user needs and privacy concerns, benefits achievable through user interaction vary across queries, can be confusing to users if same query returns different results over time.
