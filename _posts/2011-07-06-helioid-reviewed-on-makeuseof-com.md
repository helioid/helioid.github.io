Review site for cool new web services, MakeUseOf, has published a <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/dir/helioid-categorize-refine-search-results/">review</a> of our very own Helioid!
From the article, "Helioid is a new entrant in the Google-dominated search engine space that wants to help you refine your search results by checking the categories it comes up with when you search for a query. I searched for iPhone, and the categories that came up were Apps, iPad, Apple iPhone, Cases, etc, which are obviously all relevant."  We all appreciate the exposure and eagerly look forward to feedback from MakeUseOf users.
