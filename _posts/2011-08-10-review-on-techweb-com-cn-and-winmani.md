On August 4th of last week <a href="http://techweb.com.cn/">TechWeb.com.cn</a> released a <a href="http://techweb.com.cn/newsite/2011-08-04/1076354.shtml#wypl">review</a> of Helioid in Chinese (English <a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Ftechweb.com.cn%2Fnewsite%2F2011-08-04%2F1076354.shtml%23wypl">translation</a>). Here's a quote from the translation edited for grammar:
<blockquote>What is unique about it? Compared with conventional search engines, Helioid places search  results on the left column with filtering options, users can choose  which filter option, or simply show only some of the options.  Provides fast and efficient search results.  Support for Chinese search.</blockquote>

A day earlier, on August 3rd, <a href="https://winmani.wordpress.com/">Winmani</a> also released a <a href="https://winmani.wordpress.com/2011/08/03/helioid/">review</a> of Helioid in Tamil (English <a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=ta&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwinmani.wordpress.com%2F2011%2F08%2F03%2Fhelioid%2F">translation</a>). The translation quality is poor, so we've chosen what sounds like a complementary koan:
<blockquote>Search results are quickly and wisely.</blockquote>

If there's anyone who is able to help us out with a better Tamil to English translation we would be much obliged. Here's the screen shot included in the Winmani article:
