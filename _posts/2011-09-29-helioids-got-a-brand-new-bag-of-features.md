We've rolled out a new set of search refinement features on Helioid.  Now if you click on the colored circle next to a category name, your <a href="http://www.helioid.com/searches/q/sons+of+anarchy">original query</a> is amended with the name of the category, producing a <a href="http://www.helioid.com/searches/q/sons%20of%20anarchy%20cast">new search</a> drilling further down into the set of results.  Also, a "View By Site" button has been added, below the category list, which you can use to view and refine the sources from which <a href="http://www.helioid.com/searches/q/sons%20of%20anarchy%20cast#/searches/85475/sites">your results</a> are drawn.
