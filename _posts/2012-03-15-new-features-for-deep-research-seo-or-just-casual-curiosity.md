Over the last couple months, we've added a few awesome new features to further help searchers get serious about finding what's interesting to them.  You may have noticed that some time back we added the History feature, which lets you take a look at the backlog of changes in results and categories over time for a particular search.  If you find yourself periodically searching on the same topic to see what's new, you can just click the graph icon next to the search button on the results page to view the History of that search, allowing you to see how a topic has evolved over time.

More recently, we've been excited to unveil our Watches feature, which lets you save searches and receive automatic updates when new results pop up.  This enables you to stay abreast of the most recent developments in a topic of interest as they unfold.  Along with our History tool, this will be especially helpful for our research-oriented users who want to keep up with the most recent changes in evolving stories or subject areas, and will really come in handy for bloggers, site owners and SEO specialists engaging in a little brand management.  We've been using the Watches and History features ourselves to track and analyze the evolution in Helioid's exposure on tech blogs and other sites, and it's been awesome!  If you're trying to increase your site's visibility, you can Watch searches for your domain name or topical keywords, and check out the History of result and category changes for those searches, to stay up to date on who's talking about you, and what search topics would be best to optimize for.  

Or, you know, for the more casual user, you can just keep up with the news and new teasers for that movie you've been waiting forever for them to make.  Either way, happy hunting!
