<blockquote><a href="http://helioid.com/">Helioid</a> is a small startup out of New  York that's trying to change that, by delivering results tied to  categories of information. It's aiming at students, professionals and  others who are trying to do exploratory research across a topic, and  aren't just looking for a specific answer to a question.</blockquote>
