A few nights ago, after finally getting around to watching as much of Mitt Romney's RNC speech as I could bear, I had a curious dream.  In this dream, I came upon a lake covered in a haze, in the dim light of the wee hours.  And beside this lake, I found a picnic table.  And at that picnic table, sat Mitt Romney.  I sat down, we began to chat, and I was pleased to find he was much more personable than I would have guessed.  After a while, he opened up and confided that he was coming to terms with the fact that he probably wasn't going to be President.  I agreed that the odds were against him, and admitted that I myself was coming to terms with an impending transition.

We've been working for some time to establish Helioid as a self sufficient search company, aiming to succeed where many startups in this space have failed, by serving the long tail of exploratory searchers and offering advanced research tools to heavy users. We've had considerable success: we've provided a novel tool serving thousands of unique users a day, and from conversations we've had with the people who've tried us out, it's clear we've hit upon a pain point that has gone under-addressed in search.

But for a variety of reasons, the Helioid team has decided to refocus our efforts toward other interests of ours outside of search, and hold off on further major development of Helioid Search. The good news, however, is that we will maintain our present search services, and of course we will keep you all up to date on our ongoing projects.  Thank you to all of our dedicated users, and we hope you keep using Helioid to suss out the needles from those haystacks.  And thanks to Dream Mitt Romney, for listening.
