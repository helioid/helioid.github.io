Helioid's Founders just presented on the Startup Panel at this year's Society of Scholarly Publishing conference!

Past presenters on the Startup Panel have included representatives from Scribd and Mendeley, and our co-panelists this year were Richard Price, founder and CEO of Academia.edu, and Matt Dunie from Third Iron, presenting primarily on their project, BrowZine.  All fascinating, exciting stuff, and a much appreciated opportunity to talk directly to so many people working in a space we're so keen on exploring further---the academic research and publication industry.  Thanks again to Darcy Dapra for inviting us to the SSP's Annual Meeting!
