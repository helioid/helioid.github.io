Fresh  on the heels of search newcomer Blekko's launch in November, and the  ensuing debate over whether it's particularly wise for anyone to  challenge Google, the last few weeks have seen a surprising, though  gratifying, spate of criticisms of the declining quality of Google's  results for some searches. And, surprise surprise, by and large the  critiques run parallel to issues raised by Blekko Founder, Rich Skrenta,  in the months leading up to Blekko's launch, as well as to arguments  we've been making since Helioid's first launch in 2008. Finally, it  seems as though people are catching on to the fact that Google isn't  infallible, that it doesn't handle every search perfectly, that the  kinds of searches it struggles with are actually increasing in number,  and therefore that there is indeed room in the field for fresh players.

On his personal blog, Stack Overflow Co-Founder, Jeff Atwood, <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2011/01/trouble-in-the-house-of-google.html">laments</a> the increase in content-copying search spam sites regularly beating out  Stack Overflow pages in Google searches, simply by scraping Stack  Overflow content and displaying it with more ads. On TechCrunch, Vivek  Wadhwa <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/01/why-we-desperately-need-a-new-and-better-google-2/">regales us</a> with tales of his struggles against the mass manufacturers of  quasi-content, like Demand Media, which are increasingly dominating  Google's search results, without actually offering users any worthwhile  information. The <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/01/google-search-and-search-engine-spam.html">response</a> from Google has been to brush these complaints off as being in response  to a "recent uptick" in spammers infiltrating the top results, but  Atwood points to complaints dating back to 2009, from <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/content_farms_impact.php">Richard McManus</a> and <a href="http://paul.kedrosky.com/archives/2009/12/dishwashers_dem.html">Paul Kedrosky</a> touching on the very same issues. Kedrosky in particular shares his  personal horror after struggling to find trustworthy comparisons of  dishwasher brands online and being bombarded with page after page of  search spam, and concludes that the "appliance search" genre is too  spam-laden for even Google to handle. Clearly this problem isn't due to  an uptick in spammer activities confined to the last few months. And  all of these complaints resonate strongly with an issue we discussed in  our <a href="../2008/05/yes-keyword-search-is-about-to-hit-its-breaking-point/">very first blog entry</a> in 2008, which had first been raised shortly prior by Nova Spivack:  that the exponential explosion of content on the web would sooner or  later start to strain the ability of keyword search engines to  consistently place the most relevant pages amongst the top results. It  seems as though the success of content mass-manufacturers like Demand  Media and Associated Content is helping Spivack's prediction come about  sooner rather than later.

The  good news is, the creeping dissatisfaction with at least some Google  searches may help abate some of the knee-jerk skepticism of new search  engines like Helioid or Blekko, especially when they propose innovative  ways of filtering out the noise plaguing certain Google searches. Blekko CEO Rich Skrenta actually touches on a similar issue to the ones  raised by Kedrosky and Mcmanus in the CrunchTV interview we discussed  in our last blog post, concerning song lyrics. Skrenta rightly points  out that if you search for lyrics online, because it's so easy for  search spammers to copy and paste lyrics supplied by trusted sites, you  end up getting bombarded with gratuitous ads and may even pick up some  malware. Blekko has dealt with this problem by only drawing results for  lyrics searches from a limited list of trusted sites added by users  under the "/lyrics" slashtag. Blekko's ability to avoid Demand Media  filler content by drawing upon user input has been one of Skrenta's  favorite reasons to give for switching to Blekko. Even a slight decline  in the quality of Google's results may push more users into  experimenting a bit, and making that switch, and a little extra  adventurousness on the part of the users will make for a more fertile  environment for innovative search start-ups in general, including future  releases of Helioid's web exploration tools.
