The  Helioid Team has launched a new tool to share and comment upon Google  searches that fall short of satisfactory, and to take a look at other  Googlers' struggles. We affectionately call it the <a href="http://glog.helioid.com/">Glog</a>.  Back in January, we somewhat merrily reported on a spate of bloggers'  criticisms of Google's performance on certain searches, some of which  paralleled arguments we've been making about the need for more varied  approaches to search since 2008. The reason for our merriness was that  search startups in general, including Helioid, encounter a pervasive  attitude that there's no room for new players in search, largely because  Google does such a good job with the majority of people's queries. But, as we and a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/01/why-we-desperately-need-a-new-and-better-google-2/">number</a> <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/11/03/blekko/">of</a> <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2011/01/trouble-in-the-house-of-google.html">others</a> have argued for some time, there are many searches with which Google  still struggles, such as searches involving ambiguous queries or  spam-saturated searches for song lyrics or home appliances.

<a href="http://glog.helioid.com/"><img class="aligncenter" title="Glog" src="http://glog.helioid.com/images/glog.png" alt="" width="184" height="97" /></a>Enter  the Glog. Submit your query and your comments on what you wanted and  didn't quite get, and your Glog post will immediately be added to the  stack. The idea is to go beyond griping about the frustrations we've  had with some Google searches, to directly capturing some examples of the sources of  those frustrations. By keeping a collectively compiled log of the areas  in which the web search status quo doesn't quite get the job done, we  can further dispel the myth that there's no room for more players in  search, while providing brain storm fuel for any and all of our fellow  innovators in the field.
