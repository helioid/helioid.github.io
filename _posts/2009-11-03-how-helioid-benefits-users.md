The simple answer to how Helioid benefits users is that Helioid represents information and information navigation in a more efficient manner.  This gets a complex when looking at how each individual uses the internet and searches for information, but still the core is the same.  A current issue with web search, as Google's Marissa Mayer "explains":http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/09/10/marissa-mayer-clarifies-search-is-only-10-done-not-90/, is that it is undeveloped and not advanced, "Think of it like biology and physics in the 1500s or 1600s: it's a new science where we make big and exciting breakthroughs all the time."

h4. Some specific problems in this new science:

* No representation of relationships between search results on a content or conceptual level
** Information connections are "in the dark"
* No (or extremely little) representation of relationships between search results on a physical hyperlink level
* Searchers must play guessing game of coming up with correct keywords in order to get more relevant results
* No ability to refine search or to narrow in on correct result or concept
** Searchers must start over with every new search they execute

h4. Some of the solutions Helioid provides:

* Clear representations of connections between search results
** On a concept level
** On a link level
* Clear representations of categories that a search result and groups of search results fall into
** Representation subject matter shared between different results for the same query
* Can refine search so and therefore do not have to start over from scratch
** Can eliminate results or terms from search results to refine search and zoom in on wanted information
** Can save results and search query and then continue searching later
