The monograph <a href="http://www.cs.swan.ac.uk/%7Ecsmax/pubs/FnTWebSci-Wilson.pdf">From Keyword Search to Exploration: Designing Future Search Interfaces for the Web</a> [1] by M. Wilson et al. lucidly reviews the current state of search  interfaces that move beyond the traditional list of results. We've  included some choice quotations below.

On why we need better search interfaces and systems:
<blockquote>Even  more recently, though, researchers have identified just how inadequate  the familiar keyword search paradigms, provided by environments such as  Google and Bing (Microsoft's search engine), might be for users who  need to do more than just find a website that answers a factual  question. (p.9)</blockquote>
<blockquote>Exploratory  search scenarios are characterized by needs that are "open-ended, per-  sistent, and multifaceted, and information-seeking processes that are  opportunistic, iterative, and multitactical" [2]. [...] It is plain to  see that a search interface needs to provide more than a simple keyword  search form to support users in applying such strategies. (p.10)</blockquote>
&nbsp;

On problems with new search interfaces:
<blockquote>[After  evaluating textual and non-textual layouts] the conclusions were that  web search results lack "1)... a natural spatial layout of the data; and  2)... good small representations," which makes designing effective  visual representations of search results challenging. [3] (p.47)</blockquote>
